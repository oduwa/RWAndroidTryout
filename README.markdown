# raywenderlich.com Android Team Tryout

Welcome to the raywenderlich.com Android Team tryout!

We usually get far more applicants for team members than we have time to review tryouts for, so something about your application must have impressed us :]

This is a short README to explain the tryout process.

## How The Tryout Works

This tryout consists of a mock tutorial for you to edit. It is a short tutorial titled "Custom Watch Faces for Android Wear", and honestly is a pretty terrible tutorial and has a ton of problems. Your challenge is to see how many you can find and fix! :]

You have **1 week** to complete this tryout. Here are the steps to take:

1. **Read Guides.** If you haven't already, you should first read **all** of the team guides listed [on this page](http://www.raywenderlich.com/tutorial-team) (pwd tutteam). Pay close attention to the Writing, Formatting, and Tech Editor Guides, as you will be tested on information in these guides.
2. **Edit the Tutorial.** Edit the Part1.markdown file to make your improvements to the mock tutorial.
3. **Turn in Tryout.** [Send Sam an email](mailto:sam@razeware.com) when you are done, along with a rating for the tutorial (choose between “Needed Extra Help”, “In Good Shape”, or “In Excellent Shape”), and a list of bulleted comments for the author about things to improve for next time.

We will perform a diff against the original version to see your changes, and will let you know whether you passed the tryout, and if so what membership level you are invited to join the team at.

Good luck!

# FAQ

**Why am I tech editing a tutorial? I don't want to tech edit tutorials, I want to write/edit tutorials!**

The process of tech editing this tutorial will tell us a lot about your development and writing skills, attention to detail, and work ethic, which will help us determine if you're a good match for the team, and if so what level.

* **If you get invited at the bronze level**, you can update tutorials.
* **If you get invited at the silver level**, you can either tech edit or write tutorials - or choose to be bronze level.
* **If you get invited at the gold level**, you can either perform all roles - or you can choose to be silver or bronze level.

**How does formatting work?**

The Formatting guide is based upon WordPress/HTML tags, but this tryout is in Markdown obviously. Please follow the general principles outlined in the formatting guide, even though specific Markdown tags may be different.

**What if I don't pass?**

If you don't pass, don't panic - we invite less than 5% of people who apply for tryouts, and out of those less than 50% make it through the tryout, so it's not easy. Feel free to try again in our next public call for applicants - you'll be even stronger next time!
